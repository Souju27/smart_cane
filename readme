SMART CANE FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED
This project reports on a study that helps visually impaired people to walk more confidently.
This study hypothesizes that a smart cane that alerts visually impaired people over obstacles
in front could help them in walking with less accident. There are many blind people in India
belonging to different age categories that face difficulty in finding the obstacle before them
which sometimes may lead to major accidents leading to the death of that person. Blindness
disables a person from self-navigating outside well-known environments. It affects their ability
to perform several jobs, duties and activities. They are dependent on external assistance which 
can be provided by humans, dogs or special electronic devices for better decision making. This 
motivated to create a prototype called “SMART CANE FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED” 
to overcome the problems they face in their daily life. The aim of the project is to address the 
development work of a cane that could communicate with the users, which is named Smart
Cane. The main objective is to build a device in low cost and light-weight that processes signals 
and alerts the visually impaired over any obstacle, pot holes or water puddles through different 
beeping. The sensor is placed at specific position of the cane for efficient guidance. The 
development work involves coding and physical installation.
